# Dockerized Sof-ELK

## Purpose

I decided to make Sof-ELK in a dockerized deployment stack to make it:

* Easier to deploy
* Scalable
* Easy to add additional services such as file managers to uploads logs to
* Easier to manage persistent data


# Usage

## Run the stack

```
# Build GeoIP resource
bash ./sof-elk/supporting-scripts/geoip_update.sh
# Set up directories
mkdir elasticsearch-data filebeat-data
chmod 777 elasticsearch-data filebeat-data
# Bring up the stack
docker-compose up
```

**Note** that the stack will take a few minutes to come online depending on your hardware.  A few microservices will fail to start and restart until elasticsearch and logstash finish initalizing.

## URLs

Then to access kibana and droppy, access the following URLS.  They are load balanced and sent to the appropriate microservice through docker and traefik.

BASE_URL by default is localhost.
* droppy.BASE_URL - Access online file browser
* kibana.BASE_URL - Access kibana

## Data streams

If you want to add data streams into logstash, you simply need to open the ports to the logstash microservice.
Namely in `docker-compose.yaml` add ports to the `ports` section for the streams you want to allow in.
All the streams that are available are defined in the `sof-elk/configfiles/*-input-*` files.


## Method

I had to set up the stack to use the sof-ELK configure properly.  It does not have every feature in sof-elk (like the included dashboards)...yet!

I basically went to each of these files in the VM
```
/etc/logstash/logstash.yml
/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
```
And I replicated their equivilents (with correct hostnames and such) in the respective `elk_config/` configs.

The following steps were taken to set up sof-elk from the sof-elk config repo

* Copied `sof-elk/lib` to `sof-elk/lib`
* Copied `sof-elk/conffiles` to `sof-elk/conffiles`
* Copied `sof-elk/grok-patterns` to `sof-elk/grok-patterns`
* Copied `sof-elk/supporting-scripts` to `sof-elk/supporting-scrips`
* Copied `sof-elk/dashboards` to `sof-elk/dashboards`
* Copied `lsplugins` from `sof-elk/supporting-scripts/ls_plugin_update.sh` to the plugin install command in the docker-compose.yaml for logstash
* Added `logspout.conf` to `sof-elk/conffiles` for logspout
* Changed all `sof-elk/conffiles/*output*` to contain this output line (for correct elasticsearch host)
```
hosts => "elasticsearch:9200"
```
* Modified `sof-elk/supporting-scripts/geoip_update.sh` to RUNNOW=1 and use $(pwd)/resources/GeoIP

* See docker-compose.yaml for mounting of each folder inside each container and environmental variables


# Future Work

* Add cron jobs to docker just like VM for updating things like geoip etc. `sof-elk/supporting-scripts/*.cron`
* Add ELK dashboards from sof-elk
